# DEEPMD

DeePMD (Deep Potential Molecular Dynamics) [1] is a package for easily building performant neural network potentials for carrying out molecular dynamics. The DeePMD code base has been developed such that trained models can be interfaced directly to LAMMPS.

## Notes

Here we provide two sets of examples, one for training a neural network potential using DeePMD, and a second for running a LAMMPS simulation using that trained model.
We note that in order to have simple examples the model in question is trained with a small amount of data for a short period of time. Consequently, the accuracy of the resulting model is lower than we should expect for a model trained for longer on a larger amount of data.

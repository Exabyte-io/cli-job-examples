# Quantum ESPRESSO SIMPLE.x Optical Property Calculation

This folder contains various input and output reference files of optical
property calculation using `simple.x`. This example is adapted from
https://gitlab.com/QEF/q-e/-/tree/develop/GWW/examples/example05. To learn more
about the physics behind these calculation, please see the paper:
[SIMPLE code: Optical properties with optimal basis functions](
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2019.02.016).

Some of the output files are included in [output-reference](./output-reference).
